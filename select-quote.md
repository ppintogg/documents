# Description of selecting a quote process

### Client selects quote

On the client's portal, when selecting a quote, a popup window shows, so the client confirms the selecting quote. This will also prevent miss clicks.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the date selection box will only show for new businesses. Available dates are from "today" to "42 days in the future". For renewals, clients can't choose the start date.


### Account manager confirms quote selection

In the previous version, the quote was immediately submitted to insight and it was not possible to send the quotes back to the client in case of errors.

With the new process, after quote selection, policy will not be immediately sent to Insight and there will be a new "Confirm quote selection" task. When this task is open, the account manager can:
- Confirm the selected quote and that everything is correct
- Bind policy - this will bind the policy in Insight
- Resend quotes to client
- Update quotes just like before sending to the client, if there was an error

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If a quote is updated in this phase, it will not be possible to bind the policy and the button will become disabled. The only option will be to send the quotes back to the client, because they have changed since the client selected them.

### Binding policy

When clicking the button "Bind policy" a confirmation popup window will show. After confirming, the policy will be posted to Insight. After the policy is bound to insight, it will not be possible to make any change. If an error is detected, account manager will need to create an endorsement.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: the date selection box will only show for new businesses. It's pre-populated with the client's selection and available dates are from "today" to "42 days in the future". For renewals, account manager can't choose the start date.

### Approve policy

After Binding the policy, the account manager will see a success message and will still need to validate the invoice generated by Insight. Insight's response is not immediate so you will have to refresh the page after few seconds so that the button "Approve policy" becomes available.
